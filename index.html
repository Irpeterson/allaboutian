    <h2 id="From Humble Beginnings">From Humble Beginnings...</h2>

    <img src="images/Cornville1.jpg" width='400' alt="Ian as a small child"/>

    <p>I grew up in a small town in Arizona called Cornville. The town has no
      corn in it to speak of but did have a mercantile and two paved roads!</p>

    <h2 id="Travels">Travels</h2>

    <img src="images/Africa.jpg" width='400' alt="Ian in Africa"/>

    <p>I soon tired of small town life and started to travel the world. I visited:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Canada</li>
      <li>Hawaii</li>
      <li>Alabama</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and <em>many</em> other far off and distant lands</p>

    <h2 id="College"> College</h2>

    <img src="images/College.jpg" width='400'alt="Ian in College"/>

    <p> I then went to college at the Univeristy of San Francisco in exchange for
      8 years in the Army. <strong><em> What a deal!!! </strong> </em>

    <p>While in college I learned three things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Classes weren't mandatory</li>
      <li>Majoring in Liberal Arts might have been a mistake</li>
      <li>Don't fall asleep with your shoes on</li>
    </ol>

    <img src="images/Image AFGHAN.jpg" width='400'alt="Ian in Afghanistan"/>

    <p>After graduating from college I belonged to the US government and since
      so much of their money was spent teaching me how to analyze French literature
      they decided to get their money's worth.</p>

    <p>Two weeks after leaving training at Ft. Benning I was sent to Afghanistan!</p>

    <p>My 9 months playing unltimate hide and go seak went by quickly and I would
      give my whole expirence one star due to poor service.</p>

    <h2 id="After the Army"> After the Army</h2>

    <img src="images/Tank.jpg" width='400'alt="Ian fires a tank"/>

    <p> After returning from Afghanistan I spent another three years at senic Ft. Hood,
      Texas. I also did a rotation in South Korea but my memories of that rotation are fuzzy.</p>

    <p>After getting out of the Army I moved to Seattle and work in construction
      managment.</p>

    <h2 id="The Future">The Future</h2>

    <img src="images/Seattle.jpg" width='400'alt="Ian in Seattle"/>

    <p>What does the future hold for Me? A career in web design? Only time will tell!</p>
